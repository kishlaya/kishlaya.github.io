<h1 class="mb-0">Hi, I'm Kishlaya Jaiswal</h1>

  <p class="lead mb-3">Quantitative Finance Analyst</p>
  <p>I currently work as an Analyst at Bank of America. Mostly my work includes risk validation for counterparty credit risk models.</p>
  <p>Doing my graduation from <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">CMI</a> instilled me with a research attitude as well, so reading research papers (and perhaps be able to solve some problems) is something I really enjoy in my free time. My research interests broadly are complexity theory and graph algorithms. When I was working with Adobe, I also got quite interested in Topological Data Analysis.</p>
  <p>Oh and besides all the academics, I am a (Vinyasa) yoga practitioner and I play Table-Tennis to keep myself moving. I also have a countable list of things which I would like to do at some point in my life. To keep myself reminding of those (which btw I have been doing for years now) I have put them in a list <a href="#todo" onclick="reset('todo')">here</a>.</p>
