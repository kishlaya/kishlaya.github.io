  <p class="lead mb-3">Quantitative Finance Analyst</p>
  <p>I currently work as an Analyst at Bank of America. Having recently switched to finance, I have developed an interest in credit risk modeling, athough lately, a lot of my effort has been towards understanding statistical hedging.</p>
  <p>Doing my graduation from <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">CMI</a> instilled me with a research mindset, so reading research papers (and perhaps be able to solve some problems) is something I really enjoy in my free time.</p>
  <p>Oh and besides all the academics, I am a (Vinyasa) yoga practitioner and I play Table Tennis to keep myself moving. I also have a countable list (I know it exists but I can't guarantee if I can construct it) of things which I would like to do at some point in my life.</p>
