    <!-- ========== BIO ========== -->

    <section id="bio">
      <h1 class="mb-0">Hi, I'm Kishlaya Jaiswal</h1>
      <div class="mb-5">
        <p class="lead mb-3">Finance Analyst</p>
        <p>I currently work in the finance sector, as an Analyst at Bank of America. Mostly my work includes validating models for counterparty credit risk.</p>
        <p>Doing my graduation from <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">CMI</a> instilled me with a research attitude as well, so reading research papers (and perhaps be able to solve some problems) is something I really enjoy in my free time. My research interests broadly are complexity theory and graph algorithms. When I was working with Adobe, I also got quite interested in Topological Data Analysis.</p>
        <p>Oh and besides all the academics, I am a (Vinyasa) yoga practitioner and I play Table-Tennis to keep myself moving. I also have a countable list of things which I would like to do at some point in my life. To keep myself reminding of those (which btw I have been doing for years now) I have put them in a list <a href="#todo" onclick="reset('todo')">here</a>.</p>
        <p>(Here's a photo of me from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raksha_Bandhan" target="_blank">Rakshabandhan</a> 2020)</p>

        <p>When I applied for a position of Quantitative Researcher at Optiver, they asked me a very nice question to solve. You can find my solution (alongwith the problem statement) <a href="articles/optiver.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-3">which motivate me</p>
        
        <p><q>The answer to the problem of humanity is the integrity of the individual</q> by <cite>Jordan B. Peterson</cite></p>

        <p><q>In the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there is no art, no mathematics, no life.</q> by <cite>Michael Atiyah</cite></p>

        <p><q>Just as music comes alive in the performance of it, the same is true of mathematics. The symbols on the page have no more to do with mathematics than the notes on a page of music. They simply represent the experience.</q> by <cite>Keith Devlin</cite></p>

        <p><q>There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres</q> by <cite>Pythagoras</cite></p>

        <p><q>Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited, Imagination encircles the world.</q> by <cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p>

        <p><q>Nothing is more practical than a good theory</q> by <cite>Vladimir Vapnik</cite></p>

        <p><q>Rose smells the same regardless of what you call it... but in mathematics, a different name might suggest some new ideas</q> by <cite>B V Rao</cite></p>
